<!--StartFragment-->

SunWind, LLC, has been installing renewable energy since 2009, and we have worked with hundreds of Cape home- and business owners to improve their energy efficiency by using renewable energy sources such as solar PV, solar thermal and wind turbines, and in turn, saving them a lot of money on utility bills.

We stand by our commitment to quality workmanship and customer satisfaction, and our belief in a future powered sustainably by renewable energy.

## From Start to Finish

We are with you from start to finish of the project; from initial consultation to the actual install, everything is done in-house by our versatile team.

## Experience and Expertise

Our team has decades of experience in construction on the Cape, enabling us to offer innovative solutions to the most difficult design challenges. We have installed everything from small roof-mounted PV systems that prioritize the aesthetics of the Cape Cod home, to vast ground-mounts and carports that offset the energy use of a large business.

## Embedded in the Cape Cod Community

All of us at SunWind are your neighbors here on Cape Cod. Hundreds of customers on Cape and Eastern Massachusetts continue to trust us with their energy needs; here’s what some of them had to say about us:

SunWind provided us with a head-to-toe project, offering different options and scenarios based on our suggestions. The guys from SunWind are approachable, knowledgeable, and responsive, and they took care of all the paperwork. After a timely and professional installation of the system, all works well. **The system never fails; it fulfills our electricity and hot water needs. We gladly recommend SunWind.**

Hans E. (Provincetown, MA)

I just want to again thank you for your fantastic service. **SunWind explained all of the costs and incentives and most importantly handled all of the paperwork and permits which would have been a complete roadblock for a novice like myself.** The installation was clean, fast, and has generated power beyond our expectations. We are very happy with the entire process and prompt service when a minor issue arose. We would be delighted to recommend SunWind to anyone considering an alternative energy system.

— Charles C. (Quincy, MA)

My wife and I are writing to express our satisfaction with a 22-panel solar (electric) installation by SunWind LLC. We researched locally for Cape-based solar companies to do the work and installation. The 3 bids were competitive, but we chose Tim Holmes’s SunWind based on his knowledge and his willingness to work with us.

**We could not be happier with how the system is working, how it was installed for optimum solar exposure while keeping respect for visual impact.** We would recommend SunWind LLC to anyone interested in solar power installation.

— Todd and Robin L. (Sandwich, MA)

We have now had our solar electric and solar hot water system in Orleans for about six years. With the minor exception of a pump failure in the solar hot water system the systems have been flawless. **A combination of a $0 dollar power bill and the initial rebates and SREC quarterly checks of around $700 have provided about a 10% return on investment.** The owner, Tim, is very responsive and highly knowledgeable about the programs and installations options.
