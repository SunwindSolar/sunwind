## Direct Ownership

We at SunWind are big proponents of direct ownership, and as such, we discourage potential solar customers from seeking leasing options as a solution to their financing. Why? Because when you own a system (instead of leasing) you take advantage of all the incentives that are in effect in Massachusetts (such as tax incentives, SMART, and net metering, not to mention the federal tax credit as well!) that you simply do not have access to when you sign a lease. This is a substantial loss for a small short-term gain, and it really does not make sense, especially when there are loan programs in place that can make owning a solar system affordable on any budget.

## Affordable Ownership

If you’re worried that solar may be beyond your budget, have no worries! The MassCEC and SunWind are there to help you out with a solar loan program that typically covers the cost of any residential and small-to-mid-sized commercial system. We are well-versed in guiding clients through the loan process through MassCEC and third parties as well, so if you have any questions about it, feel free to contact us!

SunWind, LLC, is a pre-qualified Mass Solar Loan installer. This program is designed to help make solar affordable for all Massachusetts residents regardless of income level.

## Loan vs lease

The Mass DOER has concluded that “direct ownership of solar by MA homeowners provides substantially greater lifecycle benefits to the homeowner and local economy,” as compared to lease or PPA (power purchase agreement) options that are typically offered to make solar more affordable. With direct ownership (using the Mass Solar Loan program to help finance), system owners can take advantage of all the other incentive values that would be otherwise forfeited to the owning party. For these reasons, SunWind LLC is a strong advocate for direct ownership, and we are well-versed in the Mass Solar Loan process.
