If you have more ground area than roof space, or more solar exposure in areas of your property other than your roof, and you would still like to take advantage of all the benefits of a solar PV (and/or thermal) system, a ground-mounted system might be the solution for you. We have installed ground-mounts in both residential and commercial settings, and a common trend weâ€™re seeing these days is to install a solar carport, or a parking lot covered in solar. We think that this is a great use of otherwise-dead space, especially since its nice having your car sit in the shade anyways!
